In November 1947, at Bell Labs located on the western edge of Manhattan's
Greenwich Village. A theoratic physist Jon Bardeen, built on the theory of the
"photovoltai effect", which says that shining light on two dissimilar materials
that are in contact with one another will produce an electric voltage.

With the advance of data science, it is no longer realistic to expect one
single person to master all domain knowledge, statistics, and computer science
skills to push things forward. It's pretty common now-a-days to pair
mathematicians and software engineers in data science teams to generate
insights, advance artificial intellgence.

This is not a new concept. Theoratic physists and experimental physists has
been working together to produce extrodinary resutls throughout history. For
example, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain working together to produce
transistor.
