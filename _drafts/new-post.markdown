I heard this quote from Seth Godin's _Leap First: Creating Work That Matters_.

He uses this quote in the context of creating art. This obviously applies to
life in general. This is especially true in software engineering.

I still vividly remembers the following figure that I first saw during college
days, in one of the engineering courses. It shows one of the pitfalls that even
the most careful plans does not produce perfect solutions.

The industry now has moved on from traditional waterfall software development
life cycle into the more agile approach.
