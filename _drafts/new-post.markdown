I heard this quote from Seth Godin's _Leap First: Creating Work That Matters_.

He uses this quote in the context of creating art. This obviously applies to
life in general. This is especially true in software engineering.

I still vividly remembers the following figure that I first saw during my
college days, in one of the engineering courses. It shows one of the pitfalls
that even the most careful plans does not produce perfect solutions.

The industry now has moved on from traditional waterfall software development
life cycle into the more agile approach. However, over planing and over
engineering is still common practice, and resulting opportunity lost, legacy
software, and infrastructure, hard to maintain codebase etc.

Frequent shipping new code always beats careful planning, this of course means
frequent failure, and brings additional challenge to ensure feature and
platform robustness. How to rollback?
