**Habit I’m trying to cultivate --**

**Regularly throw things away**. In the consumer world, people accumulate so
many things that occupy spaces and carry a lot of emotional toll without
providing a lot of joy. I have a weekly reminder that I do a stocktake of all
my stuff (physically and virtually like software and files on my computer),
then I throw or delete at least one thing away. The system worked pretty well,
and it helped de-cluster my world. It also creates space (not just physical but
also in the mind) to have more things to take in whenever needed.

**Things I'm thinking about trying --**

[**Syncthings**](https://syncthing.net/). I learned its existence from reading
[this blog post](https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/). It might be the perfect
alternative to dropbox and might serve my backup needs. The drawback is that I
would prefer a cloud solution rather than having my data backed up on one of my
physical hard drives only. I’m thinking of having some ec2 instance running in
AWS and back up everything in an EBS volume. I need to give it some more
thought.
