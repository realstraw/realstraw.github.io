I loved Yuval Noah Harari's *Sapiens*. So after I finishing it, I immediately
started listening to *Homo Deus*, which to me it's like a sequel of *Sapiens*.

Rather than looking back and talk about the history of humankind in *Sapiens*,
*Homo Deus* looks to the future.

It's interesting how the book ends with Dataism, which the whole goal is to
increase data flow, and all human activities are essentially just algorithms to
process data. As a professional whose daily job is to build systems and
algorithms to process data and generating insights from data, this definitely
has resonance with me.

Data enabled artificial intelligence has definitely improved and revolutionized
many fields. However, the idea of artificial intelligence taking over the world
is still too far-fetched for me. There are still too many problems to be solved
for that scenario to become remotely possible.
