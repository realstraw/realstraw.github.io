**_[James](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173754979-james)_ by Percival
Everett**

I’m trying to add more fiction to my reading list, and James was one of them I
didn’t initially plan to read, but I ended up finishing it anyway—and I’m glad
I did.

**_[No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of
Reinvention](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules)_ by
Reed Hastings, and Erin Meyer**

Building large companies isn’t easy. Ensuring innovation while holding people
accountable in a large organization can feel impossible. Without processes and
bureaucracy, it’s hard to maintain order, but too much of it can kill
innovation. This book offers many good ideas.

**_[Autism Out Loud: Life with a Child on the Spectrum, from Diagnosis to Young
Adulthood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212228452-autism-out-loud)_ by
Kate Swenson, Adrian Wood, Carrie Cariello**

Raising an autistic child is full of challenging moments, and sometimes it can
feel like there’s no hope. It helps to remember that you’re not alone. You can
live with it, and life often finds a way.

**_[The Comfort Crisis: Embrace Discomfort To Reclaim Your Wild, Happy, Healthy
Self](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55120630-the-comfort-crisis)_ by
Michael Easter**

In an age of abundance, there is too much comfort. You can find true happiness
only by doing hard things. Take cold showers. Carry extra weight in your
backpack when you walk. Train every day. Stay focused and challenge yourself
daily. That’s how you live a full life.

**_[Daughter of
Mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176443330-daughter-of-mine)_ by Megan
Miranda**

Listening to fiction audiobooks is challenging for me because the names of
different characters often get confusing and hard to keep track of. With
practice, I think I’m getting better. The storyline of Daughter of Mine is
pretty engaging.

**_[Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized
World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)_ by David Epstein**

Specializing early often doesn’t give you an edge. In many cases, it can hurt
your ability to specialize later. Exploring and engaging with a wide range of
areas and fields helps you build a well-rounded skill set. It can also lead to
breakthroughs in your specialized area by giving you new perspectives and
helping you spot hidden connections.

**_[Goals, How to Set Them, How to Reach
Them](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2627995-goals-how-to-set-them-how-to-reach-them)_
by Zig Ziglar**

Having goals is essential for making progress. The concept is simple, but not
easy. If you follow these steps, you will be successful.

**_[The Impossible First: From Fire to Ice--Crossing Antarctica
Alone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52108552-the-impossible-first)_ by
Colin O'Brady**

Achieving the impossible is hard. It takes a lot of training and preparation.
When it happens, nothing compares to even the most comprehensive training.
Still, you keep training and move through the journey one step at a time.

**_[When We Cease to Understand the
World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62069739-when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world)_
by Benjamín Labatut, and Adrian Nathan West (Translator)**

I don’t know what I’m supposed to take away from the book. The world seems like
a dangerous place, and we’re messing around without understanding all the
implications. At the same time, everything is beautifully connected and
fascinating.

**_[In My Time of Dying: How I came Face to Face with the Idea of an
Afterlife](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798896-in-my-time-of-dying)_
by Sebastian Junger**

Dying is a difficult subject to contemplate. However, once you realize you’re
living on borrowed time, and that living means dying a little every day, many
things become easier. This realization can even lead to a more focused and
happier life.

**_[The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life and
Achieve Real
Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked)_
by Ichiro Kishimi, and Fumitake Koga**

This is one of my favorite books of the year. It features a young man in
conversation with a sage, with a back-and-forth of questions and answers.
Anyone can change, but they must first recognize it and genuinely want to do
so.

Weirdly, although it isn’t directly related, this also reminds me of a quote
from [Last Days of Night by Graham
Moore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28363972-the-last-days-of-night):

> All stories are love stories ... All men get the things they love. The
> tragedy of some men is not that they are denied, but that they wish they'd
> loved something else.

**_[Smart Brevity: The Power of Saying More with
Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59891634-smart-brevity)_ by Jim
Vandehei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz**

You can do more with less. More words don’t always mean better communication.
Less is more, and the key is to make your idea clear and easy to understand.

**_[The Crowd: A Study of the Popular
Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25870624-the-crowd)_ by Gustave Le
Bon**

I can’t believe this book was first published in 1895. You can see its ideas
everywhere today, especially in the Internet era, where the crowd behavior
described in the book shows up all around you.

**_[Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of
Indulgence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55723020-dopamine-nation)_ by
Anna Lembke**

Dopamine is the currency of motivation, desire, and drive. In the modern world,
we get dopamine hits from ultra-processed food, media that manipulates our
emotions, and many other temptations. The more stimulation we seek, the emptier
we feel inside. Understanding how dopamine works will help us live with more
intention and create a more meaningful life.

**_[All the Beauty in the World: The Metropolitan Museum of Art and
Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59364113-all-the-beauty-in-the-world)_
by Patrick Bringley**

A beautiful piece makes you appreciate the beauty in the world.

**_[I Never Thought of It That Way: How to Have Fearlessly Curious
Conversations in Dangerously Divided
Times](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59433346-i-never-thought-of-it-that-way)_
by Monica Guzmán**

Talking to people with different beliefs can be really fun. It’s not always
easy, though, especially when things get personal and people get defensive
instead of trying to understand each other.

**_[Zen in the Art of
Archery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61990665-zen-in-the-art-of-archery)_
by Eugen Herrigel**

One of the ways to experience Zen.

**_[Tribe: On Homecoming and
Belonging](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940205-tribe)_ by Sebastian
Junger**

How small, close-knit communities can support and promote good mental health
and overall happiness.

**_[Revenge of the Tipping
Point](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216857785-revenge-of-the-tipping-point)_
by Malcolm Gladwell**

When small changes build up over time, they usually lead to big,
transformational changes. Slowly heat water, and the liquid becomes gas.
Everything has a tipping point, including communities and societies.

## Books I re-read

**_[The Alchemist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/865.The_Alchemist)_ by
Paulo Coelho**

I try to re-read this book every year. It calms my soul and reminds me to stay
the course.

**_[Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36680837-meditations)_ by
Marcus Aurelius, and Gregory Hays (Translator)**

Not the best-written, but it offers the best genuine example of how one should
live their life.
