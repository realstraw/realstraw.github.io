I heard this quote from Seth Godin's _Leap First: Creating Work That Matters_,
and I cannot agree more. It is especially true in software engineering.

I still vividly remember the following figure that I first saw during my
college days, in one of the engineering courses. It shows one of the pitfalls
that even the most careful plans do not produce perfect solutions.

The industry now has moved on from traditional waterfall software development
life cycle into the more agile approach. However, over planning and over
engineering is still common practice, and resulting opportunity lost, legacy
software, and outdated infrastructure, hard to maintain codebase, etc.

Frequent shipping new code always beats careful planning. It, of course, means
frequent failures need to be easily mitigated. It also brings additional
challenges to ensure feature and platform robustness.

Engineering practices and infrastructures that geared towards fast and frequent
deployment always win. Only by constantly improving the work, release, and
test, can achieve excellence. Overplanning will almost always lead to loss of
opportunities, maintenance nightmare, and greater risks when improvement is
inevitable.
