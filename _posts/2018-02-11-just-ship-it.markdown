I heard this quote from Seth Godin's _Leap First: Creating Work That Matters_,
and I cannot agree more. It is especially true in software engineering.

I still vividly remembers the following figure that I first saw during my
college days, in one of the engineering courses. It shows one of the pitfalls
that even the most careful plans does not produce perfect solutions.

The industry now has moved on from traditional waterfall software development
life cycle into the more agile approach. However, over planing and over
engineering is still common practice, and resulting opportunity lost, legacy
software, and outdated infrastructure, hard to maintain codebase etc.

Frequent shipping new code always beats careful planning. This of course means
frequent failure, and brings additional challenge to ensure feature and
platform robustness.

Engineering practices and infrastructures that geared towards fast and frequent
deployment always win. Over planning will almost always leads to loss of
opportunities, maintenance nightmare, and greater risks when improvement is
inevitable.
