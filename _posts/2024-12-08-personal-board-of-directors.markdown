The concept of "personal board of directors" is something I came across in the
the book _Clear Thinking_ by Shane Parrish. In business, a board of directors
is a group of individuals elected by a public company's shareholders to provide
the expert and experienced guidance, as well as oversight, to ensure a
company's profitability and sustainability. Personal board of directors, on the
other hand, is a group of people (whether dead or alive, real or fictional)
that holds me accountable, and provide guidance. As described by Shane in
_Clear Thinking_:

> Look around, find the best examples you can of people with the attributes you
> want to cultivate -- the people whose default behavior is your desired
> behavior, those who inspire you raise the bar and make you want to be a
> better version of yourself. Your exemplars needn't be alive. They can be
> either dead of fictional, as well...
> 
> Put all of your exemplars on your "personal board directors", a concept that
> originates from author Jim Collins: ... they were not chosen for their
> success. They were chosen for their values and their character... They're the
> sorts of people I wouldn't want to let down.

When I read it, I immediately realized I had a personal board of directors all
along. My board consists of three people, and here they are:

**Master Shi Heng Yi (The Spirit)**

> Let it rain... I am not the body, I am not the mind, I am not my emotion...
> It's just I can see all these aspects about me.

Master Shi Heng Yi is the headmaster of the Shaolin Temple Europe. I first
learned about him through his TEDx Talk, [5 Hindrances to
Self-Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-079YIasck). His message
emphasizes that it's the journey that matters, not the end result. You must
walk the path yourself, with temperance. Master Shi Heng Yi's words are filled
with wisdom that helps me stay calm, remain humble, and stay true to myself.

**Marcus Aurelius (The Mind)**

> The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant,
> dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell
> good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good and ugliness of evil...

Marcus Aurelius likely needs no introduction. Known as the philosopher king,
his journal, _Meditations_, offers a glimpse into how he reminded himself to
living a virtuous life. No one is perfect, not even Marcus Aurelius, but what
truly matters is how we correct our course and continually strive to become
better versions of ourselves. Marcus Aurelius inspires me to be good, to
forgive, to be virtuous, and to live life in alignment with nature's demands.
We all struggle, have flaws, and fail from time to time, as evidenced in
_Meditations_. What's important is we learn from our mistakes and improve every
day.

**Jocko Willink (The Body)**

> Stay on the war path...

Jocko is the ultimate example of self-discipline. He wakes up at 4 a.m. every
morning to train and continues to work hard every single day. He has taught me
to never give up, to train relentlessly, and to grind every day. If you are not
making progress, you are falling behind. Another crucial lesson Jocko
emphasizes is the importance of building relationships. This is something I'm
not very skilled at, but I recognize it as one of the most essential traits to
achieving success and getting things done.

Things don’t always go as planned. You might not always succeed or live up to
your own values. That’s where a personal board of directors comes in—they can
guide you back on track and help you continue growing.
