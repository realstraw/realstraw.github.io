Since I have such bad writing skills (especially in English), I figure I should
start a blog and show that to the world.

My main objective is to write and publish short posts frequently. It is
inspired by the quote:

> If you generate enough bad ideas, a few good ones tend to show up

> -- Seth Godin

If I write enough bad posts, some good ones might just show up. Since probably
not that many people are reading this. What do I have to lose?

Let's see how much I can keep this going.
