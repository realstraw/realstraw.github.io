# New books I read:

**_[Life in Half a Second: How to Achieve Success Before It's Too Late](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18698097-life-in-half-a-second)_ by Matthew Michalewicz**

This book has been on my reading wish list for a very long time. It was one of the first books I added to that list.

**_[Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204927599-nexus)_ by Yuval Noah Harari**

Yuval Harari is one of my favorite authors. Sometimes I find his books a bit repetitive, but the truth and facts don't really change much. He approaches topics from different angles, allowing readers to examine them carefully and gradually start to comprehend them.

**_[How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112974860-how-to-know-a-person)_ by David Brooks**

To begin getting to know someone and nurture a positive relationship, it's helpful to engage in open communication and show genuine interest. As someone who prefers to accomplish tasks independently, this book provides valuable guidance on how to connect with others while respecting your own preferences.

**_[What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1334384.What_I_Learned_Losing_a_Million_Dollars)_ by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan**

You need to know yourself well. It’s unlikely that you are the smartest person in the room while everyone else is oblivious. If you notice trivial things that others do not, you are probably either lucky or delusional.

**_[I, Robot (Robot, #0.1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41804.I_Robot)_ by Isaac Asimov**

"Don't Let It Show" from the album "I Robot" by the Alan Parsons Project is one of my favorite songs. Consequently, Isaac Asimov's science fiction work "I, Robot" has been on my reading list for a long time, and I finally read it in 2024.

**_[The Book of Five Rings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18894249-the-book-of-five-rings)_ by Miyamoto Musashi, translated by William Scott Wilson**

Another book that has been on my reading list for a long time is The Book of Five Rings. It has been referenced in many respected articles and books.

**_[Right Thing, Right Now: Justice in an Unjust World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199334305-right-thing-right-now)_ by Ryan Holiday**

Another Stoic book from my favorite author, Ryan Holiday. This time, it focuses on justice.

**_[Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks)_ by Oliver Burkeman**

Not your typical productivity book.

**_[Good Inside: A Practical Guide to Resilient Parenting Prioritizing Connection Over Correction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59627738-good-inside)_ by Becky Kennedy**

Assume good intentions, but stand your ground.

**_[Clear Thinking: Turning Ordinary Moments into Extraordinary Results](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75665850-clear-thinking)_ by Shane Parrish**

How can you truly control yourself and prevent biology and emotions from taking over?

**_[Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31125556-destined-for-war)_ by Graham Allison**

Thucydides's Trap refers to the historical pattern where a rising power causes fear in an established power, leading to conflict. It originates from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who noted that the Peloponnesian War occurred because of the rise of Athens and the fear it instilled in Sparta.

To escape from Thucydides's Trap, nations can engage in diplomacy, build mutual trust, and foster economic interdependence. Open communication and collaboration on global issues can also help mitigate tensions. By recognizing the potential for conflict and addressing underlying fears, countries can work together to avoid the pitfalls of rivalry and war.

**_[Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122765395-elon-musk)_ by Walter Isaacson**

The guy is a genius and a lunatic, with a deeply flawed personality. Whether you like Elon or not, you cannot deny that he has pushed boundaries, achieved extraordinary things, and generated plenty of controversies.

# Books I re-read

**_[The Way of Zen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514210.The_Way_of_Zen)_ by Alan W. Watts**

Alan Watts' other book, [The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551520.The_Wisdom_of_Insecurity), is one of my all-time favorites. The Way of Zen provides me with a better understanding of how different branches of Buddhism relate to each other and how they are interconnected.

**_[Discipline Is Destiny: The Power of Self-Control](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60018575-discipline-is-destiny)_ by Ryan Holiday**

Discipline is the foundation for achieving any extraordinary things. It's hard, but that's what makes it worthwhile.

**_[The Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road)_ by Cormac McCarthy**

What would it be like to live in a world without hope? Can we be hope ourselves and carry the fire?

**_[The Alchemist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/865.The_Alchemist)_ by Paul Coelho**

The Alchemist needs no introduction. It is a book filled with magic, hope, and wisdom on how to live one’s life. Matub! Discover your personal legend!

**_[Stillness Is the Key](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43582733-stillness-is-the-key "Stillness Is the Key")_ by Ryan Holiday**

Keep calm and carry on!
