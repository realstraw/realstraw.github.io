title: "5-Point Friday (2021-12-31)"
date: 2021-12-31

This is a new project I’m starting to experiment. Inspired by Tim Ferriss’
5-Bullet Friday. My aim is to start practice writing more, and be more
conscious about myself. Pretty sure I won’t be able to write this every Friday,
but I’m going to keep building up contents everyday, and publish when I got
enough for the 5 bullets.

**Technique I’m practicing --**

[**Premeditatio Malorum**](https://dailystoic.com/premeditatio-malorum/). It’s
the practice to get ready for everything. Quoting from the article: "We don’t
always get what is rightfully ours, even if we’ve earned it. Not everything is
as clean and straightforward as we think they may be. Psychologically, we must
prepare ourselves for this to happen." Here is a [YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhHzrnUtGBY) about it.

**Book I read --**

[**Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't
Know**](https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Strangers-Should-about-People-ebook/dp/B07NDKVWZW/).
This book tells us how hard communication is and how it is so easy to have one
widely believed narrative that could be far from the truth. Admitting ignorance
gave birth to science. Accepting the fact that you can be wrong and others does
not necessarily have the intention you perceived could also be the foundation
of a tolerable and peaceful society.

**Quotes I’m reminding myself of --**

> "Do work worth doing. Shipping this work into the world is the way to live your
> life. It is the safest future we have. If you're trying to invent a safe future
> that is sure to work, you almost certainly ignoring the future that's likely to
> happen." -- Leonard Bernstein.

I read the quote from Seth Godin’s audio book [Leap
first](https://www.amazon.com/Leap-First-Seth-Godin-audiobook/dp/B00S5KH78K/),
and liked it since. The future is hard to predict, and what we can do is do
what’s best for now and make it happen. Remain agile and keep adjusting our
course. This is the only way.

**Gadget I’m loving --**

[**Anker Nano II**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08T5QN2TR/). Ever since
I started working in a co-working space. Making sure all my gears fit’s into a
backpack and has manageable weight has become my obsession. I discovered this
little charger (from Tim Ferriss’ 5 bullet friday) while optimizing my
backpack, and loving it since. It’s so much smaller than the Apple charger but
delivers the same amount of power.

**Book I’m rereading --**

[**21 lessens for 21st
century**](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179).
A lot has changed since I first read the book. Trump era ended, more
regulations on privacy and AI, and there’s a pandemic going on for years. The
questions and thoughts raised within the book do not change, and I’m getting
more thoughts around the questions raised and getting more benefits and
appreciation on looking at history and development at larger scale.
