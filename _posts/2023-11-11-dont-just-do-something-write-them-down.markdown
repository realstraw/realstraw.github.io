It's only when I am sitting down and trying to write something, I realize how
empty my head is. Here is my attempt:

* Recently I got pretty obsessed with the
    [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) method by Tiago
    Forte, seems pretty effective in organizing information.
* There seems to be a good gap between what people need and want, and it's
    funny that most of the things wanted are not needed.
* "Don't just do something, stand there" is a quote that I got from a lecture
    recently. The lecturer was talking about how leaders are generally biased
    towards making distruptive moves over observe and delegate. Have been
    witness it a lot of counter examples lately, and also need to remind myself
    to avoid doing the same.

Ok, that's pretty much it so far.
