Ideas are simple, but to communicate ideas to other people, you really need to
repeat them again and again and again.

It's not easy. You typically see best seller books talking about just one or
only a few simple ideas. Hundreds and hundreds of pages of stories just to
reinforce the key ideas and different aspects of them.

Great talks do that as well. One story after the other to illustrate the same
point.

How many stories you need to tell? The answer is as many as it takes so the
receiver can start telling their own stories to support the idea.
